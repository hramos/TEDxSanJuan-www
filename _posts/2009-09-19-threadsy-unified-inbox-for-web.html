This conference puts almost 50 startups in the spotlight, giving them six minutes to pitch their business and then get drilled by a panel of celebrities, CEOs and investors.</p><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><p><span class="full-image-inline ssNonEditable"><span><img style="width: 150px;" src="http://c185824.r24.cf1.rackcdn.com/Screen%20shot%202009-09-19%20at%203.28.24%20PM.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1253388629569" alt="" /></span></span></p><br/><p>So the big winner was <a href="http://www.redbeacon.com">RedBeacon</a>, a service that allows you to locate professionals in a specific city and have your orders fulfilled over the web. Another interesting start up was <a href="http://www.citysourced.com/">CitySourced</a>, a service that allows city dwellers to report grafitti, crime, potholes and other such problems to their city council as a kind of 311 service. I won&#8217;t go into <a href="http://www.citysourced.com">CitySourced</a> now, though, or go through issue of <a href="http://www.appsfordemocracy.org/dc-awards-10000-final-prize-to-iphone-facebook-app-combo/">other Open 311 initiatives</a> from around the country. I liked CitySourced, they had a great demo and I am looking forward to it being available in my city (fat chance).</p><br/><p><span class="thumbnail-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><a href="http://c185824.r24.cf1.rackcdn.com/Screen%20shot%202009-09-19%20at%203.51.04%20PM.png"></a></span></span></p><br/><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://c185824.r24.cf1.rackcdn.com/3835484-4195984-thumbnail.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1253389921175" alt="" /></p><br/><p><a href="http://blog.threadsy.com/2009/09/17/threadsy-snags-2nd-place-at-techcrunch-50/">Second place was awarded to </a><a href="http://blog.threadsy.com/2009/09/17/threadsy-snags-2nd-place-at-techcrunch-50/">Threadsy</a>, and this is what I will be covering today. This company demoed a service that aggregates all your e-mail addresses and social networks into a single inbox. FriendFeed, you say? Not really. Threadsy takes a different approach.</p><br/><p>You see, <a href="http://www.friendfeed.com">FriendFeed</a> lets you subscribe to a person&#8217;s stream, which can be made of a huge collection of blog posts and web services. It feels like an evolution of <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, with its greater range of features and conversation tracking; perhaps the main reason it got bought out by Facebook. On the other hand, Threadsy is all about <em>your services</em>. It aims to create a unified inbox, where no more a friend of yours will wait days or months for a reply.</p><br/><p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="http://c185824.r24.cf1.rackcdn.com/Screen shot 2009-09-19 at 3.10.51 PM.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1253389835313" alt="" /></span></span></p><br/><p>Have you ever logged into <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, only to notice that someone sent you a message four days ago but you never noticed? Sure, you may have seen the Flickr e-mail notice, and perhaps thought you&#8217;d deal with it later. Problem is, that e-mail is now marked as read, you moved on and forgot to log into Flickr.</p><br/><p>Flickr may not be the best example to use, as Threadsy only supports e-mail, Facebook and Twitter at the moment. However, as you can see in the main Threadsy window, my stream is now divided into a inbound and unbound inbox. I can see all my e-mail, from various accounts, on the left, alongside any Twitter DMs, @mentions and Facebook notifications. On the right, I see a combined view of all my Twitter accounts.<span class="thumbnail-image-inline ssNonEditable"><span><a href="http://c185824.r24.cf1.rackcdn.com/Screen%20shot%202009-09-19%20at%203.12.35%20PM.png"></a></span></span></p><br/><p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 400px;" src="http://c185824.r24.cf1.rackcdn.com/Screen%20shot%202009-09-19%20at%203.17.52%20PM.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1253388004643" alt="" /></p><br/><p>I can reply by DM or public @mention using the inbox on the left without any extra effort. Threadsy makes sure that my messages are routed appropiately. This is called the inbound inbox - any message that makes its way here, is something that was sent to you directly.</p><br/><p>The box on the right, the unbound inbox, displays all messages, regardless of the recipient. Which means that all of your Twitter and <a href="http://blog.threadsy.com/2009/09/18/threadsy-adds-facebook-messages-to-your-inbound/">Facebook stream</a> will show up here. One feature I really like is that Threadsy fetches the avatar associated with that person&#8217;s profile.</p><br/><p><span class="full-image-inline ssNonEditable"><span><img src="http://c185824.r24.cf1.rackcdn.com/Screen shot 2009-09-19 at 3.35.24 PM.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1253388990544" alt="" /></span></span></p><br/><p>So far I am really liking the interface. Although I prefer to have <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/">Tweetie</a> open and use Mail whenever I am on my laptop, I have found that this is the tool to use when I am at work, where it might not be too smart to keep multiple websites open calling for my attention. I only need to have one tab open and periodically check the inbound inbox to see if I have missed anything.</p><br/><p>I am looking forward to Threadsy adding more service integration and this could be a big winner in my book. Will it be profitable? That remains to be seen. FriendFeed allegedly sold for $50 million to Facebook, since it may prove essential in helping Facebook compete with Twitter. However, who would Threadsy benefit?</p><br/><p>You may visit <a href="http://www.threadsy.com">Threadsy</a> and ask for a beta invite if you wish to try it out.</p><br/><p><em>Update: </em>I forgot to mention that, in a similar manner to FriendFeed, Threadsy does aggregate all of your friend&#8217;s profiles. You can click on a friend and see a list of all their associated profiles for a huge range of services, not only Facebook and Twitter. I do have some issues with it mixing up my friend&#8217;s identities, but this is something I will probably take up privately with the developers and help them debug.</p>
