<p>First full day of the South by Southwest Film + Interactive festival&nbsp;<br />is now over. It&#8217;s been more of Interactive rather than Film, as all&nbsp;<br />the panels and activities has just overwhelmed us.</p><br/><p>We arrived on Thursday to Austin and were able to get to know downtown&nbsp;<br />city thanks to Pablo&#8217;s (<a href="http://www.polsense.inc">http://www.polsense.inc</a>) previous knowledge of&nbsp;<br />Austin and meeting up with Manuel Rosso. We got a good sense of the&nbsp;<br />city and the layout and most popular places, which got us all set for&nbsp;<br />Friday&#8217;s SXSW kickoff.</p><br/><p>Badge pickup was a half hour line or so but organized, you would fill&nbsp;<br />out a card with your info ad after matching it to your my.sxsw profile&nbsp;<br />(which you should have filled out by now) they would quickly print out&nbsp;<br />your badge.</p><br/><p>The use of location based services I very high in Austin, in part due&nbsp;<br />to it being the homebase of Gowalla, but mostly due to the influx of&nbsp;<br />techies during this weekend. It is a different feeling when you check&nbsp;<br />in anywhere and there&#8217;s 10 to 50 people who&#8217;ve checked in there in the&nbsp;<br />last 20 minutes. And that&#8217;s just the coffeeshops. Popular SXSW events&nbsp;<br />reach a few hundred. You check in, look to the side and there&#8217;s X from&nbsp;<br />Y company or blog sitting near you, checking in as well.</p><br/><p>And this was just Thursday night before the offcial start of SXSW.</p><br/><p>Friday morning had no panels yet so we went to the Texas State Capitol&nbsp;<br />grounds. The Capitol building is higher than the D.C. Capitol, I&#8217;m&nbsp;<br />told. Yep, everything is bigger in Texas. The building is beautiful,&nbsp;<br />as well as the grounds. Walking back we decided to grab lunch from the&nbsp;<br />ONE TACO truck near the Austin Convention Center. We ran into the guys&nbsp;<br />from Gowalla, and their Gowalla MINI Clubman. They are a cool bunch,&nbsp;<br />and we are big fans of their applications so it was very nice to meet&nbsp;<br />almost the whole team in person. The ONETACO tacos are tasty, by the&nbsp;<br />way, especially the bacon loaded Gowalla taco. Try them!</p><br/><p>On to the first panel&#8230; We all split up, hitting the SXSW intro&nbsp;<br />(Addis), History of the Button (Pablo) and Beauty in Web Design&nbsp;<br />(myself). Afterwards it was the Chasing Virtual Goods panel by Josh&nbsp;<br />Williams, CEO of Gowalla, where we caught up again with the Gowalla&nbsp;<br />peeps.</p><br/><p>Last panel of the day was Mark Cuban vs Avner of Boxee on the future&nbsp;<br />of streaming video on the TV. It was a very interesting head on&nbsp;<br />discussion until the fire alarm went off and we had to evacuate the&nbsp;<br />convention center. Turned out to be a false alarm, so we could see the&nbsp;<br />end of the debate. It was pretty heated, and myself being a Boxee fan,&nbsp;<br />I found agreeing with Cuban&#8217;s points against the success of a la carte&nbsp;<br />programming.</p><br/><p>We wanted to see the Kick Ass movie premiere, but we got there and the&nbsp;<br />line was almost 2,000 people strong. After a while we were told the&nbsp;<br />teather was at capacity so we had to leave. At least we got to see all&nbsp;<br />of the starring actors in person at the red carpet.</p><br/><p>Got some food, and headed back for the nightlife in downtown Austin.&nbsp;<br />There are many, many places, all with their own unique charm. The&nbsp;<br />location based services are great for finding the nearest hot spot and&nbsp;<br />discovering new venues.</p><br/><p>That&#8217;s about it. One day gone and still one week to go before it&#8217;s&nbsp;<br />over. There are a couple neat panels tomorrow and some great events:&nbsp;<br />This Week in Startups Live, Hubble 3D, Diggnation Live. I hope I can&nbsp;<br />make it to all of them.</p><br/><p>I&#8217;ll see when I can post again. Typed up all of this on my iPhone&nbsp;<br />thanks to the lack of free Internet access at our suite.</p><br/><p>And remember, if you&#8217;re here in Austin, follow me: @hectorramos</p>
