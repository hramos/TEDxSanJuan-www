<p>Today a protest is being held in the capital of Puerto Rico, San Juan. It has become an actively discussed topic in Twitter, under the <a href="http://hashtags.org/">hashtag </a>#ParoPR.</p><br/><p>To aid in the aggregation of the crowdsourced information being spread through Twitter, a small group of citizens have set up a <a href=" http://paropr.posterous.com">Posterous blog that so far has&nbsp;successfully covered various sides of the ongoing protests</a>.</p><br/><p>Please visit the Posterous blog at <a href=" http://paropr.posterous.com">http://paropr.posterous.com</a>. It would also be very helpful to tweet about this event using the hashtag #ParoPR, which could help and spread the word about the ongoing events.&nbsp;</p><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><p><em>Disclosure: I created the Posterous blog for ParoPR, however the content is being supplied by a dozen or so contributors from the local Twitter community.</em></p>
