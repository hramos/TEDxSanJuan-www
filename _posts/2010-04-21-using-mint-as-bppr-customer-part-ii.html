<p>Last month I wrote a <a href="http://www.hectorramos.com/journal/2010/3/3/using-mint-as-a-bppr-customer.html">guide on using Mint as a BPPR customer</a>. Some people were able to get it to work, but the success rate was no way near 100%.</p><br/><p>A couple of weeks later, <a href="http://www.mint.com">Mint</a> changed the way they handled BPPR accounts, but only temporarily. Fortunately, Mint has resolved the situation and all BPPR customers should be able to link their online banking accounts.</p><br/><p>Miguel Rios, of <a href="http://noveltica.com/">Noveltica</a>, covers the steps that need to be done in order to <a href="http://noveltica.com/nuevo-conecta-tu-cuenta-del-banco-popular-con-mint-com/">link your BPPR accounts</a>. Please note that you will need to search for <a href="http://www.popular.com">Banco Popular de Puerto Rico</a>, as opposed to Popular (PR).</p><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><br/><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4308278671813780009-8570750467443903091?l=hector-omar.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
