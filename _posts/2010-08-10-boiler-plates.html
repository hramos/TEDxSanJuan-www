<p>You&#8217;ve been reading about HTML5&#8217;s new features for months. You sit down and set out to write a new website - do you remember all the best practices?</p><br/><p>HTML5 boiler plates take care of this initial hurdle for you. Here are two that I&#8217;m currently using in some upcoming projects:</p><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><ul><br/><li><a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boiler Plate</a></li><br/><li><a href="http://html5reset.org/">HTML5 Reset</a></li><br/></ul><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><p>Don&#8217;t just extract the code and do minor adjustments. This is a great opportunity to see HTML5 code that has been carefully tended to by groups of web developers for months.</p>
