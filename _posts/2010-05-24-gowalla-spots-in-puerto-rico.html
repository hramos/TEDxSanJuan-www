I currently have it  set so that it will tweet out a maximum of six new spots, with the last  tweet pointing out how many new spots where not tweeted due to the hard  limit of six. I thought this would be enough, since it only runs once an  hour, but I agree that it can become annoying if there are many spots  being created during the day. <br /> <br />I want to know - is it fine the way it is, since only Gowalla fans  would follow it anyway and would still be interested in this  information, or should I lower the limit? <br /> <br />Would it be better, then, to run the service twice per hour? This  would hopefully split the updates in half. <br /> <br />@arkhangel also suggested a way to find dupe spots. I&#8217;m  going to think about this, I could probably use the GPS and name to mark  which are suspected dupes. <br /> <br />I&#8217;m also considering opening up an RSS feed of all the spots, and  adding geolocation data to the tweets sent out, so that you can see the  location of the spots from your favorite Twitter client without going  into the Gowalla website.</span></span></span></span></p><br/><br/><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4308278671813780009-3390381903174960609?l=hector-omar.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
