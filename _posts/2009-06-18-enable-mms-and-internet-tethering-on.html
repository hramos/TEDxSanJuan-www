<h3><em><strong>UPDATE: </strong></em></h3><br/><p>I&#8217;ve removed all information related to the enabling of Internet Tethering and MMS on your iPhone. I believe the information is sufficiently spread out through the web, and such topic falls out of the scope of my personal website. Additionally, MMS still won&#8217;t work as long as you are on an iPhone Messaging plan - that is, until AT&amp;T officially supports it. Internet Tethering still works, but you shall proceed at your own risk, as your carrier may still charge you for the usage.</p><br/><p>For my Spanish speaking friends, please visit <a href="http://www.iphonefanatic.net">iPhone Fanatic&#8217;s website</a> for more information on the topic.</p>
