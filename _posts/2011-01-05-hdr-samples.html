<p>On New Year&#8217;s Day, Addis and I took a road trip to the southwestern corner of the island. We visited the seaside cliffs of Cabo Rojo&#8217;s <a href="http://gowalla.com/spots/305070">Los Morrillos</a> lighthouse, where I snapped the following picture with my iPhone 4.&nbsp;</p><br/><p>The iPhone 4 has a software HDR function which takes various pictures in quick succession, each with varying exposure levels, and merges them into a single composite which should have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging">higher dynamic range</a> of colors (which your monitor probably can&#8217;t display properly, but done right, still looks better than a single exposure picture, but I won&#8217;t go into the details). The iPhone 4 also saves the original, single exposure picture in case you prefer it over the HDR.&nbsp;</p><br/><p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hramos/5326925333/" title="No HDR by Hector Ramos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5002/5326925333_cd0807c1c3.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="No HDR" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hramos/5326925333/" title="No HDR by Hector Ramos, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5002/5326925333_cd0807c1c3.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="No HDR" /></a></p><br/><p>Can you spot the difference?</p><br/><br/><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4308278671813780009-2220337725572652372?l=hector-omar.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
