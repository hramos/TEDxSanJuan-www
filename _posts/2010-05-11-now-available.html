<p>Roughly one week after being <a href="http://www.hectorramos.com/journal/2010/5/3/comlink-11-update-soon.html">submitted</a>, the 1.1 update to <a href="http://www.hectorramos.com/apps/comlink.html">COM:LINK</a> is now <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=322502765&amp;mt=8">available in the App Store</a>.</p><br/><p>Among squashing various bugs that should fix most communication drops, I&#8217;ve added a new setting to <em>lock</em>&nbsp;the Talk Button. Access it from the new in-app Menu found at the bottom of your COM:LINK.</p><br/><p>There you will also be able to buy an upgrade to COM:LINK+ which can also send pictures to other COM:LINK users. The upgrade is for the lifetime of the COM:LINK app, so expect future updates to add to the COM:LINK+ repertoire.</p><br/><br/><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4308278671813780009-6113683011857353266?l=hector-omar.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
