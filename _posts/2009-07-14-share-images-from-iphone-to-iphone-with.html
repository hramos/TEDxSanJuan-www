<p>We&#8217;ve released a <a href="http://www.hectorramos.com/iphone-app-listing/">new application</a> for the iPhone and iPod Touch which allows users to send and receive images without the need of a network (cell or Wi-Fi) connection. This is due to the Bluetooth capabilities unlocked by iPhone OS 3.0.</p><br/><p><span class="full-image-float-left ssNonEditable"><span><img src="http://c185824.r24.cf1.rackcdn.com/original-4.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1247607034799" alt="" /></span></span></p><br/><p>How does it work? After pairing both devices by launching <a href="http://www.hectorramos.com/imageshare">ImageShare</a>, you can just go ahead and take a new picture or select one from your photo albums. Hit Send, and the image smoothly slides over to the other iPhone or iPod. It is automatically saved to the receiver&#8217;s photo album. That is all there is to it!</p><br/><p><a href="itms://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=320375566&amp;mt=8&amp;s=143441">Download ImageShare on the iTunes App Store today for free.</a> This is just the first version, lots of features have already been added for v1.1 which should be out next month!</p>
