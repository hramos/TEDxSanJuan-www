Apple finally unveiled their latest product:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">the iPad</a>.</p><br/><p>It runs iPhone OS 3.2 *at the moment*, although I&rsquo;m sure it will see iPhone OS 4.0 at its release due to the amount of changes to support iPhone and iPad applications.</p><br/><p>I&rsquo;ve gone over the new SDK already, like what I&rsquo;m seeing, and of course I am announcing an update to my bio: I&rsquo;m now an iPad Developer, as well. :D</p>
