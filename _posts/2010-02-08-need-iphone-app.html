<p>Finding out what it takes to develop an iPhone app is a&nbsp;lengthy&nbsp;process - first an idea needs to be developed into a sound design, resources need to fit the development schedule, and deadlines need to be met. However, before we go through all these steps, we first need to establish a <a href="/request-quote/">business relationship</a>.</p><br/><p>There is a trend where I am usually contacted by an idea person - someone who has a general idea of what an &#8220;awesome&#8221; iPhone application would be like, all they need is for me to develop it and retain 50% or less of the profits. If this fits you, I&#8217;m sorry to say I am not the developer you&#8217;re looking for. This is a high risk situation which does not benefit me. Really, do the math. There is a small chance of the application making it big. If it fails, I&#8217;ve just lost weeks of development time and you&#8217;ve lost nothing. If it works, you&#8217;re sharing in 50% of the profits without having done much at all - ideas are nothing, execution is everything. I&#8217;d rather use my free time to develop my own, just-for-fun <a href="/apps/">iPhone apps</a>.</p><br/><p>If you&#8217;re still reading this and think that you could work with me on an iPhone application, great! Please <a href="/request-quote/">request a quote</a>. The form will allow me to have a better idea of what you need to be developed. The complexity of the application will help me determine if I should reach out to trusted iPhone developers or if the application can be executed by just a single developer. It also helps me let you know quickly how much it is going to cost to develop the application.</p><br/><p>Developing an iPhone application is not cheap. The development costs cover equipment, utilities, office space and salaries. Also, some features such as Push Notifications carry a recurring cost. I hope that establishing a formal <a href="/request-quote/">application development request for</a>m will help everybody meet their expectations.</p>
