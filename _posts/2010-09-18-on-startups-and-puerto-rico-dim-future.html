<p>As I write this, the backup power supply beeps to let me know I have only 10 minutes left until I lose power. The only light source in here is my laptop&#8217;s monitor, and its 300 feet through various dark hallways to the nearest exit.</p><br/><p>It&#8217;s 4:40 PM on a sunny Saturday afternoon in Puerto Rico, and the lights have gone out in my office.</p><br/><p><a title="14-September-2009 - Milla de Oro at night HDR by I Am Rob, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/robertrex365/3920924479/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3428/3920924479_35127472d4.jpg" alt="14-September-2009 - Milla de Oro at night HDR" width="500" height="334" /></a></p><br/><p>To those that follow me on Twitter, you know that this is not a new occurrence. Power is constantly going out at my office and at my apartment. Like it or not, living without electric service is a mainstay of life in a tropical island. A couple of weeks ago the whole of the metropolitan area surrounding San Juan lost service hours before Hurricane Earl passed by. The head of the AEE (Puerto Rico&#8217;s power company) could only lay blame on standard everyday outages, rather than admit that their network went down hours before the arrival of the storm.&nbsp;</p><br/><p>With leadership like this, and a distribution network that nobody can rely on, how can Puerto Rico even think there is a chance of getting its stuff together?</p><br/><p><a title="Milla de Oro, Hato Rey by I Am Rob, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/robertrex365/4560910432/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3574/4560910432_e487702caa.jpg" alt="Milla de Oro, Hato Rey" width="500" height="268" /></a></p><br/><p>It seems like the only way some one living in Puerto Rico can get through the day is by taking a government job or settling for a corporate office job. If by any chance you are considering starting a new business, the costs may very well be too high.</p><br/><p>When your office suffers a power outage, productivity levels go down the drain as employees seek&nbsp;coffee shops with Wi-Fi - that is, after they suffer a two-hour traffic jam to get home and find out power is out back home, too. If that&#8217;s not enough, then the rent that goes with leasing a better office in a building that has a power generator will. That won&#8217;t do much to help, anyway, since the Cable Internet provider for the metropolitan area is so horrendous, it will be very likely that you won&#8217;t have online access anyway.</p><br/><p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/naturallyabel/2589500130/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3033/2589500130_025ecaed06.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1284843589108" alt="" width="183" height="250" /></a></span></span></p><br/><p>What is this post, more than another one of my rants? This post is my commitment to get out of this energy-draining, so-called &#8216;paradise&#8217; within two years. Two years ago I made the same commitment to get out of my corporate job and join a startup - I think leaving this island is the next logical step.</p><br/><br/><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4308278671813780009-3445698610958202663?l=hector-omar.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
