<p>This is it. I am packing up, as light as possible, to leave in a few hours on a flight to San Francisco. I don&#8217;t expect to post too frequently while spending my week at the WWDC, so the best you can do is follow me on Twitter: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/hectorramos">@hectorramos</a>. I&#8217;ll be updating constantly once I land in San Francisco.</p><br/><p>If you&#8217;re attending the WWDC, please give me a shout. I&#8217;ll be arriving around 10 PM on Saturday night.</p>
