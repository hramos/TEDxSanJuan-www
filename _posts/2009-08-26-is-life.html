<p>That simple statement has created an uproar in Puerto Rico. &#8220;Rivieras del Caribe&#8221;, a proposal to revive the lands given back to Ceiba by the US military, is led by Jaime Gonzalez. Monday, August 24 saw the release of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOK5dweZEaQ">video taken mid-July, during which Jaime Gonzalez told Ceiba residents that indeed, the proposal is geared toward tourists and affluent people</a>, if you can&#8217;t afford the stores, you may go and take a stroll and watch the cruise ships come in. They can also people-watch the rich as they shop! And if you don&#8217;t like it, well, &#8220;such is life.&#8221;.</p><br/><p>The phrase was quickly picked up by the Puerto Rican Twitter community. A common comeback for any kind of whine is, well, &#8220;such is life!&#8221; In honor of the phrase, <a href="http://redod.com/?p=29">redod has created a new design to commemorate the life of the rich and affluent</a>!</p><br/><p><span class="thumbnail-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><a href="http://c185824.r24.cf1.rackcdn.com/Sushi-Is-Life-copy.jpg"><img src="http://c185824.r24.cf1.rackcdn.com/3835484-3967237-thumbnail.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1251318228961" alt="" /></a></span><span class="thumbnail-caption" style="width: 350px;">OK, so inspiration turned the design into a Sushi chef stylization of Jaime Gonzalez, and the phrase might have been changed a little, but hey, such is life!</span></span></p><br/><p>The design has been uploaded to <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/redod">CafePress</a>, for the sole enjoyment of those who can afford to <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/redod">buy a T-Shirt</a>!
