<p>Here&#8217;s a short video which covers my recent trip to a mountain villa in Puerto Rico.</p><br/><p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://wanimoto.clearspring.com/o/46928cc51133af17/4b494de91c6ca9d3/46928cc51133af17/65b3c55b/-cpid/99a31d5eceac09ae/-EMH/240/-EMW/432/widget.js"></script></p><br/><p>It was made using <a href="http://www.animoto.com">Animoto</a>, an awesome online service which takes your pictures and videos and creates a professional looking video. It costs $3 per full length video, or $30 for a year of unlimited full length videos. You can try it out for free (limited to 30 second videos); this is a short video about my trip to Mayag&uuml;ez:</p><br/><p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://wanimoto.clearspring.com/o/46928cc51133af17/4b494eee5ba52013/46928cc51133af17/6728d5d1/-cpid/1252506958bd7c67/-EMH/240/-EMW/432/widget.js"></script></p><br/><p>I upgraded to an All Access account, in part due to the great quality of the videos and also thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ckorhonen">Chris Korhonen </a>from Animoto, who quickly responded to a small rendering issue I had with the Loma Sol video. Their excellent support helped to finalize my decision to pay for the All Access service.</p><br/><br/><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4308278671813780009-6350358347454439791?l=hector-omar.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
