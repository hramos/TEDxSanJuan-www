<p>Google is launching a new service today, which seems to be a big foray into the social arena, an area where they have been historically lacking.</p><br/><p>I don&#8217;t know much about what&#8217;s coming, but it seems like we will all know within the hour. I can only guess that the name of the new product shall be &#8220;Google Buzz&#8221; if I go by <a href="http://twitter.com/hectorramos/status/8863611108">Scoble&#8217;s tweets</a> and MG Siegler&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/09/google-buzz-event/">Tech Crunch article</a>. They all seem to be dancing around the &#8220;buzz&#8221; while trying to avoid to break their NDAs.</p><br/><p>Follow <a href="http://www.youtube.com/feb0910googleevent">the event</a>.</p>
