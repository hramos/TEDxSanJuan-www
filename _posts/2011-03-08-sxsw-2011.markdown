So I’m leaving in a few hours for SXSW. I’ve been looking forward to visiting Austin again, seeing friends and meeting in person everyone I’ve been interacting with online.

Let me know if you’re going to be in Austin this weekend for SXSW!

PS: I’ve been working on a new blog based on Jekyll. It’s almost done, but I don’t think it would be prudent to deploy it just before leaving for this trip. So that explains the lack of blogging - I keep telling myself I should wait until the new site is up!
