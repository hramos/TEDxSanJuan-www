<p>Two weeks ago, during WWDC09, we met up with Victor Agreda, Jr., editor at <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2009/06/26/wwdc-demo-parranda-for-iphone-and-ipod-touch/">The Unnofficial Apple Weblog</a>. We demoed the Parranda application for iPhone and iPod touch, and talked about its success in the Puerto Rican market. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the article:</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>The enthusiastic developers of Parranda were at <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/tag/WWDC/">WWDC</a> to show off their app, a simple one-man-band party in your hand. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=297296714&amp;mt=8">Parranda</a> (iTunes link) has a lot of polish, too, with instruments that aren&#8217;t just one big button, like some &#8220;soundboard&#8221; music apps. The cowbell, for example, allows you to tap on different parts of the instrument, which any decent cowbell player will tell you, creates very different sounds. Mostly. You can zoom in or out on the instruments, something you will have to see in the video, but it is a nice effect and adds to the experience.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>You can also watch a video of our demo below. Those are my neatly manicured hands holding my previous iPhone 3G while Pablo Lopez goes over the different musical instruments in Parranda:</p><br/><p><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/WbhAhkCvRxA&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/WbhAhkCvRxA&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></embed></object></p><br/><p>Shortly after this video was recorded, Parranda 2.1 - NuYorican Edition was approved. It introduces the new Parrandator all-in-one instrument, which allows you to create your own parties without switching out instruments.</p><br/><p><a href="http://www.parrandapr.com">Parranda</a> was developed by <a href="http://www.vayabroqui.com">Vaya Broqui</a> and is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=297296714&amp;mt=8">available on the iPhone App Store for $2.99</a>.<span class="full-image-float-left ssNonEditable"><span><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=297296714&amp;mt=8"><img src="http://parrandapr.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/app_store_badge_0708_small.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1246057999110" alt="" /></a></span></span></p><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><br/><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4308278671813780009-470307455118434864?l=hector-omar.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
