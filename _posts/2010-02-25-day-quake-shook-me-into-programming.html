I still remember that day.</p><br/><p>I was a 12 year old video game lover who used to tinker with computers at school but had only just got my own PC a few months before. Computer games caught my eye, since for the first time I might be able to program my own game. I had this realization when a friend showed me Doom and how he would load it up with modified levels and sprites.</p><br/><p>The Doom mod community was mature and daunting for a 12 year old who had only just discovered it. The arrival of <a href="http://quake.wikia.com/wiki/Qtest">QTest</a> meant that I would be able to be there from the start. I got it from Tucows, probably, and proceeded to play for hours. This was the game I would learn to program and mold to my own idea of the perfect video game.</p><br/><p>Eventually, Quake was released and the mods started to appear all over the net. Programming for Quake was pretty easy - the language was called <a href="http://planetquake.gamespy.com/captured">Quake C</a>. It was the perfect language to learn programming. It was based on C, had the same syntax, but didn&#8217;t have structures or arrays. This made it easy for my pre-teen mind to grasp the basics and kept me from needing to learn data structures too early. I would compile my mods using qcc (the QuakeC Compiler) which I later learnt was a play on gcc as I moved up to C (Quake II dropped QuakeC) and C++ (Half-Life).</p><br/><p>I recall writing a few tutorials on how to make your weapons fire multiple rockets, which would spin around using trigonometric functions I had just learnt that day in school. I got into 3D modelling and 2D texture mapping. I got into level design and writing specs. I created a website and joined <a href="http://planetquake.gamespy.com/captured">Captured.com</a> as an editor.&nbsp;</p><br/><p>I guess you could say that thanks to QTest, I learned how to program in C and C++, learned how to use 3D Studio to create models, learned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning">basic computer science concepts</a> while making game levels, develop pretty good Photoshop skills while texturing all the models. I created a modification for Quake which had my entire high school as the game level, and enemy players looked like the principal. Players were dressed with the school&#8217;s uniform. It was a hit in my high school&#8217;s new LAN, where we would stay after school to have huge 16 player deathmatch skirmishes. The teachers, of course, didn&#8217;t agree with us shooting down other students, then Columbine happened, and my Quake mod was forever deleted. Wish I had backed it up&#8230;</p><br/><p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.fileshack.com/file.x/17307/Quake+Deathmatch+Test+%28QTest%29">QTest</a>, I developed interest in everything that led me to study Computer Engineering.&nbsp;Thank you, id Software.</p>
