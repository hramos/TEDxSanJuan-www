<p>I received an e-mail from Netflix today. It seems like they want me back as a client!</p><br/><p><br /><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/comeback.JPG?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1244213786985" alt="" /></span></span></p><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><p>They are even offering me their <strong>instant watch</strong> feature:</p><br/><p><a href="javascript:showFullImage('/display/ShowImage?imageUrl=%2Fstorage%2Fcomebackiw.JPG%3F__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION%3D1244213826804',371,966);"><img src="/storage/thumbnails/3835484-3268457-thumbnail.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1244213826805" alt="" /></a></p><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><p>Of course, as soon as I sign up with them again, they&#8217;ll tell me the feature is not available in Puerto Rico. Even though they keep advertising it when they ask me to come back after I cancelled the service for not being able to use Instant Watch.</p><br/><h3>Hey Netflix, I&#8217;m ok with you if studios really do limit your licensing, even if it seems shady that none would include Puerto Rico (the Instant Watch ban is not title-specific, but service-wide). <strong><em>But please don&#8217;t try to lure me back with false promises.</em></strong></h3><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><br/><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4308278671813780009-3949936677568965083?l=hector-omar.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
