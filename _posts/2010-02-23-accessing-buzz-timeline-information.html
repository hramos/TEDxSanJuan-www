<p>Quick update regarding the use of <a href="http://buzz.google.com">Google Buzz</a> data that may interest developers.&nbsp;As of today:</p><br/><p>You can access a user&#8217;s timeline as an <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom</a> feed using the following URL</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>http://buzz.googleapis.com/feeds/{user}/public/posted</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>This is just one user&#8217;s updates, NOT what the user sees in Buzz. You will get a stream of updates, or Buzzes, authored by {user}.</p><br/><p>If one were to develop a Buzz client, one would actually need the whole of the timeline seen by the user inside the Buzz tab in Gmail.&nbsp;At the moment there is no one central place where a developer can fetch the Buzz timeline for all the people you follow.&nbsp;However, you may use Contacts access and then iterate through each contact&#8217;s public atom feed, and integrate that into your client.&nbsp;</p><br/><p>This, however, is not as useful because you don&#8217;t have access to Groups and so on. It is a good temporary solution, but Google should have the API soon. Probably faster than you can code a good, stable scraping solution.<br /><br />This is why you won&#8217;t see native Buzz clients soon. Whomever does that will have a hell of a problem maintaining their custom scraping code. Some people have started their own <a href="http://allurbuzz.appspot.com/">firehose scraping projects</a> already.<br /><br />Google shall soon (weeks, months) release a proper API with oAuth. That&#8217;s when the barrage of iPhone + iPad apps will arrive.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, there are ways to publish data to your own timeline. To do so requires the setup of a service feed that must be linked by the user in their Google profile. Using&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">PubSubHubbub</a>&nbsp;the Buzz will appear almost immediately. This is not the equivalent, though, of authoring new Buzzes from a simple mobile client, as the user still needs to associate their profile with the service - a kind of temporary solution while Google finishes their oAuth implementation.</p>
