Being a tall guy, I prefer to use the desk surface to place the keyboard and mouse, instead of using a keyboard tray. However, this places the monitor a few inches below eye level. So for a long time, I have been using two or three thick books to prop up the monitor.</p><br/><p>Why didn&#8217;t I get a monitor stand? Well, most of them are $30 or $40 at least, and they still are no more than 10&#8221; wide or so. This is actually annoying, as I can&#8217;t push the keyboard or mouse underneath, which is the most comfortable position for me. Then I saw <a href="http://ikeahacker.blogspot.com/2008/12/tv-shelf-with-door-stoppers-for-legs.html">this post at IKEA Hacker</a> with instructions on how to create a stand using cheap hardware and decided I would do the same.</p><br/><p>Ten months later, I finally set out to Home Depot. I knew I needed a roughly 36&#8221; by 8&#8221; shelf, and around 4&#8221; of lift. I found a black shelf with similar dimensions, and got four 3&#8221; door stops. All for under $15:</p><br/><p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img style="width: 250px;" src="/storage/IMG_5088.JPG?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1256181293790" alt="" /></span></span></p><br/><p>Black Shelf: 8.28<br /> Doorstop (4@1.71): 6.84<br /> Total: $13.82</p><br/><p>To build this, you&#8217;ll need a drill, a 3/32&#8221; drillbit (might vary, check your doorstopper&#8217;s dimensions), a ruler and a pencil to mark off the locations for the door stops. If you haven&#8217;t figured it out by now, the door stops will serve as the legs of this monitor stand. Why? They provide the lift I need, without occupying too much desktop area.</p><br/><p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/IMG_5086.JPG?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1256186800247" alt="" /></span></span></p><br/><p>&nbsp;You can do this by yourself, certainly. However, I had someone help me with the measurements.</p><br/><p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/helper.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1256186819867" alt="" /></span></span></p><br/><p>For these door stops, which are roughly an inch wide, I measured 0.5&#8221; from each edge and marked it off. You might want to try 1&#8221;, but don&#8217;t over do it or you will end up with an unstable stand. Once you have the spot marked, get your 3/32&#8221; bit and drill a guide, a little over halfway in - just make sure it does not go out the other side.</p><br/><p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/IMG_5094.JPG?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1256186838659" alt="" /></span></span></p><br/><p>Then you will want to take one of the door stops, and screw it in by hand. Really, if you don&#8217;t know how to screw this into the hole, you have a problem.</p><br/><p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/IMG_5095.JPG?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1256186861860" alt="" /></span></span></p><br/><p>Actually, you might need a little help to finish screwing it in. Just get some pliers and tighten them up.</p><br/><p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/IMG_5099.JPG?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1256186882400" alt="" /></span></span></p><br/><p>&nbsp;Repeat for all for corners, flip and place on your desk. New monitor stand!</p><br/><p>&nbsp;<span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/IMG_5100.JPG?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1256186938972" alt="" /></span></span></p><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><p>It feels pretty good, gives me enough height and I can comfortably push the keyboard and mouse around without hitting anything. I might get a fifth door stop because it is sagging a little in the middle, but so far it seems like it will hold up. That&#8217;s it! Soon, I&#8217;ll show you how to build your own desk out of a door and some height adjustable legs. First, I need to build it, though.</p><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><br/><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4308278671813780009-9024541550047687337?l=hector-omar.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
