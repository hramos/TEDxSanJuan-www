<p>The past few weeks have been hectic, so I&#8217;ll keep it short.</p><br/><p>1. I&#8217;m leaving for <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">Apple&#8217;s Worldwide Developer&#8217;s Conference 2010</a> in a short few hours. This is going to be my second year. This time I&#8217;m heading out alone, so if you see me around, come and say hi :)</p><br/><p>2. I quit my job. Will be working now fulltime with iPhone and iPad development, amongst other things. More on that later.</p><br/><p>3. The best way to keep up to date with my POV coverage of WWDC is through my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hramos">Flickr</a> and Twitter accounts.
