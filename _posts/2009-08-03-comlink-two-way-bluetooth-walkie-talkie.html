<p>Our latest application, <a href="/comlink/">COM:LINK</a>, is built upon the iPhone&#8217;s new Bluetooth Voice Chat functionality. It allows two friends to chat through their iPhone or iPod Touch using the Bluetooth connection, with out running down their minutes.</p><br/><p>Of course, you will need to be within a few hundred feet of each other for the Bluetooth connection to be established. Once paired, two buddies can chat all they want through their COM:LINK radio - organize your own &#8220;secret missions&#8221; for play, or use it in real situations where there is no cell signal coverage - great in San Francisco!</p><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><p>&nbsp;The decibel meter goes up and down as you speak into the COM:LINK. It works just like a real radio - hold down the Talk Button to chat with your buddy. Mute your speakers to mantain your cover.</p><br/><h3>Availability</h3><br/><p>COM:LINK is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=322502765&amp;mt=8">now available on the iTunes App Store for FREE!</a></p><br/><p>Look for our upcoming COM:LINK companion app which will include extra features.</p>
