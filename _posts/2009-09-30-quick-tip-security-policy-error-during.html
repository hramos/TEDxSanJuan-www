<p>Today I ran into a problem when I tried to deploy my code to my iPhone. I saw the following cryptic message:</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>Error launching remote program: security policy error.<br />The program being debugged is not being run.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p><br />The problem usually shows up for jailbroken devices, but mine is not jailbroken. I solved this problem by deleting all of my expired provisioning profiles. Seems like 3.0 has a problem using the correct profile, and if any expired profile is present it won&#8217;t allow for deployment.</p><br/><p>Now I am having problems deploying to my 3.0.1 iPhone after downgrading from 3.1b5. I had used the symlink Xcode trick, but now it doesn&#8217;t work, even after removing the symlink. Any one in my same position?</p>
