<p>I find it much simpler to share quick updates and links on my Tumblr, so I&#8217;ve added it as a sub-domain: <a href="http://blog.hectorramos.com">http://blog.hectorramos.com</a></p><br/><p>I realize it might be a little confusing to have two blogs, but consider this main Journal as more of a source of infrequent articles while the Blog might have more frequent short updates. I&#8217;ll see how I can merge these later into a single page.</p><br/><br/><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4308278671813780009-4362678957644552120?l=hector-omar.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
