<p>Living outside of Silicon Valley is not entirely bad, as my previous post might make you think. Here&#8217;s an <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/09/18/why-startups-outside-tech-cities-arent-totally-farked/">interesting piece by Drew Curtis</a> who owns Kentucky-based <a href="http://www.fark.com">Fark</a>. He covers the benefits of living outside the big cities:</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>Cost of living is extremely low, and office space is cheap and plentiful. Traffic is pretty mild; Lexington has one of the five&nbsp;<a href="http://www.americantowns.com/ky/lexington-information">fastest median commute times in the country</a>:&nbsp;19.3 minutes (people who work at home weren&rsquo;t counted). &nbsp;Energy costs are some of the lowest in the United States (yay coal). &nbsp;Real estate is cheap, both residential and commercial. It&rsquo;s not very difficult to find houses for sale around here for $66 per square foot;&nbsp;$150,000 for a 2,500-square-foot, four-bedroom home probably sounds amazing to people crammed in a NYC apartment.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>Unfortunately this might not be entirely true for San Juan, Puerto Rico. These reasons are the same I gave myself four years ago when I graduated from college and turned down various job offers in the States. I could stay in Puerto Rico, it&#8217;s less expensive and I can give back to my country!&nbsp;</p><br/><p>Pshaw. A $150,000 apartment? Outside of the city, perhaps, which is easily an hour to two hours of commute in heavy traffic each way. I live in Trujillo Alto and even when I worked in nearby Cupey, that was 40 minutes if traffic was light during the morning, then 50 minutes on the drive back in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Cable internet is more or less $50 for 4Mbps down, and shitty 0.5Mbps up, and that&#8217;s with a one-year contract. Most other options are around $60 - $90 for 2Mbps DSL.</p><br/><p>Further down, Drew mentions that Lexington is one non-stop flight away from the big tech cities. Taking a flight as necessary is cheaper than living full time in San Francisco, for example. I wish the same could be said about Puerto Rico, but being in the middle of the Caribbean Sea means one thing: it&#8217;s at the very least 1.000 miles to the nearest state. A trip to San Francisco is easily 12 hours from take off to final landing, usually going through a two hour layover in DFW or LAX. Airfare? $600 if you&#8217;re lucky.</p><br/><p>As for infrastructure, read my <a href="/journal/2010/9/18/on-startups-and-puerto-ricos-dim-future.html">last post</a>. Sigh.</p><br/><p>I will keep fighting the good fight, helping my entrepreneurial friends and organizing events for startup-minded folks, but as Drew says, there must be more execution and less talking about it.&nbsp;</p><br/><p>What do you think about running a startup in Puerto Rico?</p><br/><br/><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4308278671813780009-3326214182220315792?l=hector-omar.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
