[The answer to &#8220;Will you mentor me?&#8221; is no](http://pindancing.blogspot.com/2010/12/answer-to-will-you-mentor-me-is.html)

_If you claim to be &#8220;very passionate about X&#8221; but have never done anything concrete in X I find it difficult to take you seriously. People who are really passionate about anything don&#8217;t wait for &#8220;leaders&#8221; or &#8220;mentors&#8221; before doing *concrete* work in the area of their passion, however limited. Specifically wrt to programming/machine learning etc in the days of the internet and with sites like Amazon or the MIT OCW you have no limits except those you impose on yourself._

_For some reason Bangalore is crawling with people who first want to form a community and then start learning/working/whatever. These efforts almost invariably peter out uselessly. First do the work. Then if you feel like &#8220;communing&#8221; talk to others who are also working hard. Please read [this](http://www.teamten.com/lawrence/writings/plan05.html"), sent to me by my friend Prakash Swaminathan._
