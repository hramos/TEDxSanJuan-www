At the last Quakecon I took a show of hands poll, and it was interesting to see how almost as many people there had an Android device as an iOS device. But when I asked how many peple had spent 20 bucks on a game in the Android store, there was a big difference. You’re just not making money in the Android space as you are in the iOS space._

I've [said it before](http://hectorramos.com/day-quake-shook-me-into-programming), I got into programming thanks to John Carmack's work during the 90's.
