People who are really passionate about anything don&#8217;t wait for &#8220;leaders&#8221; or &#8220;mentors&#8221; before doing *concrete* work in the area of their passion, however limited. Specifically wrt to programming/machine learning etc in the days of the internet and with sites like Amazon or the MIT OCW you have no limits except those you impose on yourself.</em></p><br/><p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8230;</p><br/><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>For some reason Bangalore is crawling with people who first want to form a community and then start learning/working/whatever. These efforts almost invariably peter out uselessly. First do the work. Then if you feel like &#8220;communing&#8221; talk to others who are also working hard.Please read&nbsp;<a href="http://www.teamten.com/lawrence/writings/plan05.html">this</a>&nbsp;, sent to me by my friend Prakash Swaminathan.</em></p><br/><p>Sent my way by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/onedgepr">Pablo</a>, who says &#8220;replace Bangalore with Puerto Rico.&#8221;</p><br/><br/><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4308278671813780009-6034007510428969582?l=hector-omar.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
