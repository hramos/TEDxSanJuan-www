Built upon the iPhone’s new Bluetooth Voice Chat functionality. It allows two friends to chat through their iPhone or iPod Touch using the Bluetooth connection, with out running down their minutes.

Once paired, two buddies can chat all they want through their COM:LINK radio – organize your own “secret missions” for play, or use it in real situations where there is no cell signal coverage – great in San Francisco!

The decibel meter goes up and down as you speak into the COM:LINK. It works just like a real radio – hold down the Talk Button to chat with your buddy. Mute your speakers to mantain your cover.

ImageShare lets you share pictures with your friends! Take advantage of the newly available Bluetooth connection to instantly send pictures to another iPhone or iPod Touch.
No signal? No problem! Bluetooth works in tunnels, indoors and wherever even in the absence of a cellular network. Just pair up your device with a friend’s and start sharing your pictures!

Images slide over from one iPhone or iPod to the other as if they were the same device.

Can’t send an e-mail with your picture due to lack of signal? No Wi-Fi means your iPod Touch can not send pictures through e-mail. Don’t feel left behind, use ImageShare to send pictures over Bluetooth instantly.

Your buddy just sent you a link to a YouTube video, but you are at work where the website is blocked. What do you do?

You have an iPhone which can watch YouTube videos! But wait, how do you launch that specific video your buddy sent? Easy!

Open up YouTool and type in the YouTube Video Code found at the end of all YouTube URLs. YouTool will launch the native iPhone YouTube app and you will be watching your YouTube video in seconds!

### …but my iPhone already has a YouTube application! ###

Sure, but you only have a link to YouTube. You need to know the name of the video to at least begin searching for it. You can’t open the link to the video because the website may be blocked. YouTool allows you to quickly launch that specific video without wasting minutes searching for it in YouTube.
