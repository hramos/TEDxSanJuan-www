			<h2>Our Team<h2>
			<div class="news">
				<p>We are a team of entrepreneurial thinkers and doers in Puerto Rico committed to creating an innovation-based culture in all fields.</p>
				<p>After following other TEDx events in hundreds of cities worldwide, we decided that Puerto Rico was up next. Not only does it deserve to have the opportunity to host such an event, but, more importantly, we know that there is a strong, creative, and committed community of Puerto Ricans who are executing innovative ideas that are having an impact in many parts of the world.</p>
				<p>So, with that in mind, we set out to create our first TEDxSanJuan event. </p>
				<p>As speakers, we strive to have some of the most innovative and impacting Puerto Ricans and friends of Puerto Rico in the world.</p>
				<p>As attendees, we strive to gather some of the most curious and active doers in Puerto Rico.</p>
				<p>We&#039;re honored to be part of the TEDx community, and hope to unearth Puerto Ricans who have ideas worth spreading.</p>
