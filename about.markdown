I'm Héctor Ramos, an iOS developer for [Polsense](http://polsense.com), an up and coming startup in sunny Puerto Rico. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from [UPR Mayagüez](http://www.uprm.edu) in 2006. Worked at EVERTEC as a system architect and senior programmer for the Internet department which served [BPPR](http://www.bppr.com), Puerto Rico's largest bank.

Work didn't keep me from tinkering with various technologies, which got me into freelance iPhone development. Shortly before hitting my fourth anniversary at EVERTEC, I quit in order to pursue iOS app development and startups fulltime, joining Polsense.

I have been a PC user all of my life. My main workstations have all been Windows based systems, along with several Linux servers for development, testing and deployment. In 2008, however, I switched to Mac. Wow.

I still keep around my custom built quad core Intel PC - it is my baby, a very powerful machine where I can both develop and play all the latest games. It provides me with a lot of flexibility to test anything out. However, I love my Macs. I use them every day and I don’t have to worry about breaking them and losing important data.
